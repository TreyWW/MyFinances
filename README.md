MyFinances is an open-source web application designed to empower individuals and teams to efficiently manage their finances.
Whether you're tracking personal expenses, managing client invoices, or planning your financial goals, MyFinances provides a
user-friendly platform to streamline these tasks.

| PLEASE NOTE: This project is still in development, and has only just started! So none of the key features or descriptions have been fully implemented. We are beginner friendly and looking for contributors! |

## Key Features

- **Expense Tracking:** Easily record and categorize your expenses, upload photos of receipts, and visualize spending patterns.

- **Invoicing:** Generate professional invoices for clients, including options for hourly rates or fixed fees. Receive payments
  directly through the integrated payment gateways.

- **Financial Reports:** Gain insights into your financial health with customizable reports, income summaries, and expense
  analyses.

- **Receipt Management** Store your old receipts, to keep as future tax deductions, or just a financial log. You can preview,
  download, or delete these receipts at any point! We also use parsing to auto-extract data from the receipt such as the total
  price.

- **Budgeting:** Set financial goals and track your progress. Keep an eye on your spending habits and make informed decisions.
