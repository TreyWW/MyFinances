    Generates a cron expression for AWS EventBridge based on the specified frequency.

    Args:
        frequency (str): The frequency of the schedule. It can be "monthly", "weekly", or "yearly".
        day_of_month (int, optional): The day of the month for the schedule. Required for monthly and yearly frequencies.
        day_of_week (int, optional): The day of the week for the schedule (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday). Required for weekly frequency.
        month (int, optional): The month of the schedule (1 for January, 12 for December). Required for yearly frequency.
        date (datetime.date, optional): The specific date for the schedule. Can be used for monthly frequency instead of day_of_month.

    Returns:
        CronServiceResponse: The response containing the cron expression or an error message.

    Examples:
        - Monthly schedule on the 15th day of each month:
            get_schedule_cron(frequency="monthly", day_of_month=15)

        - Weekly schedule on every Tuesday (2nd day of the week):
