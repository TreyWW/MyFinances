07-02-2025

In the Installation manual, While I was Installing the project using pycharm on
Windows 10, and using the terminal, following the instructions, I typed in
1.   Create a virtual environment and activate it

python -m venv ./venv/ -->  that worked

I then followed instructions and typed in
./venv/Scripts/activate

I struggled for a while but when I accidentally used the \ rather than a /  and walla,
everything worked fine in that I installed the directories and files as expected.

It may be an idea to update the installation manual -> 07-02-2025
Also the installation manual does not have a date on it
Suggestions:
==============
2.  A requirements.txt doc for simplicity
3.  Platform/Operating system  not listed anywhere
4.  main.py???   -->  what and where  is the entry point of the program
5.  External libraries - I seem to have found the requirements.txt - Please update me
6.  I have spotted some dll's and no date on this project.  How long has this project
been around and would you like some help refactoring and make project more accessible?

I still don't know how to start up project.  And I have been through every single folder in project, read
README.md, security.md, pyproject.toml ???.
