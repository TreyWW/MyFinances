# Setting up AWS

First you'll need to setup an AWS Account and login to the AWS CLI on your device.

You will also need [`pulumi`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/) to be installed. In their installation guide you can also
find the [`Getting started with AWS`](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/clouds/aws/get-started/begin/) guide and try an example
project get a feel.


!!! tip
	Before running `pulumi up` you may want to run `pulumi preview --diff` to see what will actually be modified. Make sure
	nothing important is deleted/changed!


After pulumi is installed you can follow to process below:

```shell
cd infrastructure/aws/pulumi/

pulumi up
```

Now you should see a list of things, use the arrow keys to go down to "details" to see exactly what will be created.

!!! danger
	You may not want to create a new VPC or override an existing one, be careful at this step!


Now as you likely won't want a new or changed VPC (as this can be very dangerous for any existing AWS services using this VPC)
you can import your existing VPC. Go to the ['VPC Console'](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/vpcconsole/home) on AWS
and you will see your VPC, copy the "VPC ID".

Now type in:

```shell
pulumi import aws:ec2/vpc:vpc/Vpc main_vpc [ID OF YOUR VPC]

# e.g. pulumi import aws:ec2/vpc:Vpc main_vpc vpc-01and2357151sounds5501Good73
```

And press "yes". You may want to do the same with the subnets:

```shell
pulumi import aws:ec2/subnet:Subnet main_subnet [YOUR SUBNET ID]

pulumi import aws:ec2/subnet:Subnet private_subnet [YOUR SUBNET ID]
```
