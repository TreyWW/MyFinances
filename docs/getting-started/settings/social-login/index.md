# Social Logins

Social logins are highly, highly suggested. This removes the security from your hands to another service like google.
A lot of users would rather use a popular service to handle their details then us, which makes sense!

We currently only support two options, but feel free to add a contribution to add more!

- [GitHub oAuth](github.md)
- [Google oAuth](google.md)
