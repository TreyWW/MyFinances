# Empty Pages on load

If you have empty pages when you load, no content is shown, or you are getting errors in your browser console,
you are likely missing our javascript dependencies - such as HTMX. Please run `npm run webpack-build`.
For more details, checkout ["Webpack for JS"](../../../getting-started/installation/#webpack-for-js).
