title: Github Issues
---

Our main development area for this project is our [Github](https://github.com/TreyWW/MyFinances). On github you can create
`Issues`. These are a sort of discussion that you can open which keeps lots of messages, code snippets and progress in one place.

When suggesting an idea, we would rather you first start off a
[`discussion`](https://github.com/TreyWW/MyFinances/discussions/new?category=ideas). This allows us to talk about the idea
before any development is made on it. After we'll convert it to an `Issue`.

??? bug "Found a bug?"
    Use Github Issues for bug reports too! You can fill in the `Bug Report Form`
    [here](https://github.com/TreyWW/MyFinances/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=1-bug_report.yml&title=bug%3A+)
    to report these bugs to help us reproduce them.
