??? note
    This is a message from the maintainer and project owner, [`@trey`](https://github.com/TreyWW).

At the start, I made this project for myself to help me manage my clients. This allows me to store the details of each client,
create invoices to send to them after work is complete, and in general keep everything in one place. But I decided to make it
opensource in hopes to motivate me to work on it more, and allow others to use my creation.

Now we have lots of contributors helping make this product! I want the product to be a useful tool for freelancers, small
business owners, or in general anyone that needs to manage customers. It isn't a typical "CMS" though, we hope to give you
tools to integrate communication between customers (like invoicing, automatic schedules, and emails) too.
